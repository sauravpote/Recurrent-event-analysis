# Recurrent-event-analysis

Recurrent event analysis is a statistical method for analyzing repeated occurrences of an event over time, with each occurrence representing a new episode of the same event. We have compared several models commonly used in recurrent event analysis and presented it with visualization techniques in R for interpreting the results.  We had our focus particularly on these models: the Prentice-Williams-Peterson (PWP) model , the Andersen-Gill (AG) model, frailty model, and marginal model for time-to-event data.
 It provides a detailed overview of each model, including their assumptions, advantages, and limitations. Thus, then presents several visualization techniques for interpreting the results of these models, including the recurrent event graph, and the predicted hazard function. All visualizations are demonstrated using the R statistical software. At the end we've concluded with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the different models and visualizations, highlighting their usefulness for different types of research questions and datasets. Overall, this  provides a valuable resource for researchers interested in recurrent event analysis and visualization in R. 
 The data used for analysis was taken from an open-source data world (https://data.world/muasifkn/asthma-prevention-trial-in-young-children)
